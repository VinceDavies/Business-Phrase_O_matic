# Business-Phrase_O_matic
The goal of this app is to make a ridiculous sentence that only business/econ majors will try make sense of.
The format for the sentence is "We need [noun x] to [verb y] the [noun z]."
Example: "We need a supply-sider mentality to empower the human capital effort."

The sentence is created by randomly selecting from 3 different word banks and subsequently mashing them together. 
For added fun, the sentence will also be spoken to you.
Enjoy.
